# 0x0A. Python - Inheritance

This project focuses on understanding and implementing inheritance in Python. It covers concepts such as superclass, subclass, method overriding, multiple inheritance, and more.

## Resources

- [Inheritance](link_to_resource1)
- [Multiple inheritance](link_to_resource2)
- [Inheritance in Python](link_to_resource3)
- [Learn to Program 10: Inheritance Magic Methods](link_to_resource4)

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What is a superclass, base class, or parent class
- What is a subclass
- How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
- When can an instance have new attributes
- How to inherit a class from another
- How to define a class with multiple base classes
- What is the default class every class inherits from
- How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
- Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
- What is the purpose of inheritance
- What are, when and how to use `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type`, and `super` built-in functions

## Copyright - Plagiarism

You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet the above learning objectives. Plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a newline character
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc

### Python Test Cases

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should end with a newline character
- All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`
- All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
  - A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified)
- Do not use the words `import` or `from` inside your comments, the checker will think you try to import some modules
