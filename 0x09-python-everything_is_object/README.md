# 0x09. Python - Everything is Object

This project covers the concept that everything in Python is an object. It includes various tasks to reinforce understanding of objects, classes, mutability, and other related concepts.

## Resources

- [Objects and values](link_to_resource1)
- [Aliasing](link_to_resource2)
- [Immutable vs mutable types](link_to_resource3)
- [Mutation](link_to_resource4)
- [Cloning lists](link_to_resource5)
- [Python tuples: immutable but potentially changing](link_to_resource6)

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What is an object
- What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is the difference between an immutable object and a mutable object
- What is a reference
- What is an assignment
- What is an alias
- How to know if two variables are identical
- How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
- How to display the variable identifier (memory address in the CPython implementation)
- What is mutable and immutable
- What are the built-in mutable types
- What are the built-in immutable types
- How does Python pass variables to functions
