# 0x0C. Python - Almost a Circle

This project involves working with classes and unit testing in Python, implementing serialization, deserialization, and handling named arguments in functions.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

- What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
- How to serialize and deserialize a Class
- How to write and read a JSON file
- What is `*args` and how to use it
- What is `**kwargs` and how to use it
- How to handle named arguments in a function

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a newline character
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All your modules should be documented: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
- All your classes should be documented: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should be documented: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`

### Python Unit Tests

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should end with a newline character
- All your test files should be inside a folder tests
- You have to use the unittest module
- All your test files should be Python files (extension: .py)
- All your test files and folders should start with `test_`
- Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for models/base.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base.py
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m unittest discover tests`
- You can also test file by file by using this command: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py`
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases so that you donâ€™t miss any edge case
