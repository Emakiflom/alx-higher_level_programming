# 0x11. Python - Network #1

This repository contains solutions to tasks related to network programming in Python, focusing on fetching internet resources using the `urllib` and `requests` packages.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the help of Google:

- How to fetch internet resources with the Python package `urllib`
- How to decode `urllib` body response
- How to use the Python package `requests`
- How to make HTTP GET requests
- How to make HTTP POST/PUT/etc. requests
- How to fetch JSON resources
- How to manipulate data from an external service

## Requirements

**General**

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file at the root of the repository, containing a description of the repository
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- You must use `get` to access dictionary values by key (it won’t throw an exception if the key doesn’t exist in the dictionary)
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified)
- Your code should not be executed when imported (by using `if __name__ == "__main__":`)
