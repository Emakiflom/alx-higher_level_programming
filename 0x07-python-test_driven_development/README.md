# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

In this project, we delve into the world of test-driven development in Python, emphasizing the importance of testing, writing documentation, and utilizing doctest for interactive tests.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the help of external resources:

1. **Why Python programming is awesome:**
   - Highlight the strengths and advantages of Python as a programming language.

2. **What's an interactive test:**
   - Understand the concept of interactive tests, particularly in the context of doctest.

3. **Why tests are important:**
   - Recognize the significance of writing tests for code reliability and maintainability.

4. **How to write Docstrings to create tests:**
   - Learn how to use docstrings effectively to create tests and documentation.

5. **How to write documentation for each module and function:**
   - Emphasize the importance of documenting modules and functions for clarity and understanding.

6. **What are the basic option flags to create tests:**
   - Familiarize yourself with basic option flags used in test creation.

7. **How to find edge cases:**
   - Develop the skill of identifying and testing edge cases in your code.

## Copyright - Plagiarism

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Interpretation/Compilation:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- **File Endings:** All files should end with a new line
- **First Line:** The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- **README.md:** A mandatory README.md file at the root of the project folder
- **Code Style:** Your code should use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- **Executable Files:** All your files must be executable
- **File Length:** The length of your files will be tested using wc

### Python Test Cases

- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **File Endings:** All your files should end with a new line
- **Test Files Location:** All your test files should be inside a folder named `tests`
- **Test File Type:** All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
- **Test Execution Command:** All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- **Module Documentation:** All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- **Function Documentation:** All your functions should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)')
- **Documentation Content:** A documentation is not a simple word; it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified)

### Collaboration on Test Cases

- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases to ensure comprehensive coverage, as the Checker will verify tests.
