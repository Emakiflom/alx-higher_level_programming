# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

## Overview

This project delves into the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. Understanding the concepts of classes and objects, attributes, methods, and various aspects of OOP is crucial. By the end of this project, you should have a solid grasp of the fundamentals of OOP in Python.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain, without the help of Google:

- Why Python programming is considered awesome.
- The principles of Object-Oriented Programming.
- The concept of "first-class everything."
- What a class is and how to create one.
- The distinction between a class and an object or instance.
- What an attribute is and how to use public, protected, and private attributes.
- The purpose of `self` in Python classes.
- What a method is in the context of OOP.
- The role of the special `__init__` method and how to use it.
- Concepts like Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding.
- What a property is and its significance.
- The difference between an attribute and a property in Python.
- The Pythonic way to write getters and setters.
- How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class.
- How to bind attributes to objects and classes.
- The purpose of the `__dict__` attribute of a class and/or instance.
- How Python finds the attributes of an object or class.
- How to use the `getattr` function.

## Requirements

### General

- **Allowed editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.8.5).
- All your files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
- All your files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
- All your modules, classes, and functions should have documentation.

Documentation is not a simple word; itâ€™s a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method. The length of it will be verified.
