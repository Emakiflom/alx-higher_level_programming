# 0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping

This repository contains solutions to the Python - Object-relational mapping project for Holberton School. The project focuses on linking databases and Python using the MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy modules.

## Background Context

In this project, you will utilize the MySQLdb module to connect to a MySQL database and execute SQL queries. Additionally, you will use the SQLAlchemy module, an Object Relational Mapper (ORM), to abstract the storage to the usage. With an ORM, your biggest concern will be "What can I do with my objects" and not "How this object is stored? where? when?". You won’t write any SQL queries, only Python code. Last thing, your code won’t be "storage type" dependent. You will be able to change your storage easily without re-writing your entire project.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the help of Google:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- How to connect to a MySQL database from a Python script
- How to SELECT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
- How to INSERT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
- What ORM means
- How to map a Python Class to a MySQL table
- How to create a Python Virtual Environment

## Requirements

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- Your files will be executed with MySQLdb version 2.0.x
- Your files will be executed with SQLAlchemy version 1.4.x
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- All your modules, classes, and functions should have documentation
